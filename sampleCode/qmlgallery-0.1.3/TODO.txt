- FIXME: Review pinch-to-zoom algo, it could be optimized
- FIXME: It often happens that the listview is flicked while you're trying to zoom-in
- FIXME: graphics glitch when going back from an image (due to the sliding animation, the cached image flashes)
- Investigate vibration of the image (is it really due to the contentX/Y being qRound()ed before set?)
- Add change of zoom center while zooming in and changing the center at the same time
